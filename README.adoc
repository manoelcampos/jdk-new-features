== Oracle Java Language Changes

Since JDK 13, the oficial Java language documentation site has improved a lot,
providing specific articles for each new feature.
You can check the documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/language/index.html,
where you can replace 13 by the JDK version you wish.
