/*
A bunch of arbitrary Java commands to run in jshell without creating
a Java class.
Use the run-java-commands-with-jshell.sh script for that or type the
following command at a terminal:

    jshell JshellJavaCommands.txt

It's used .txt extension instead of .java because
since that file mises a class definition, it won't compile
in the regular IDEs, making the entire project build to fail.
